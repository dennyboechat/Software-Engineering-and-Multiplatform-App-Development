UC Biosketch React Native App
====================================

This app is a University of the Cumberlands (UC) Biosketch built with React Native and designed to run in the Snack simulator.

How it works:
-------------------
- The main file is `App.js`, which loads the `AssetExample.js` component.
- `AssetExample.js` displays your professional picture, a welcome message, course ID, and your bio sketch.
- The background uses the official UC color (#e60026).

How to use the assets folder:
-----------------------------------
1. Add your professional picture to this folder as `profile.jpg` (or `profile.png`).
2. The app will automatically import and display this image in the UI.
3. If you use a different filename, update the import path in `AssetExample.js` accordingly.

Enjoy your personalized UC Biosketch app!
